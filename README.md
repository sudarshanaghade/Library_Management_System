Project Title: Library Management System in C++

Description:
This project is a simple yet fully functional Library Management System built using basic C++ features, relying only on the <iostream> and <string> libraries. The system allows users to add, view, search, borrow, return, and filter books based on their category. It uses structures to represent both books and borrowers, and manages all data using a fixed-size array.

Key features include:

Adding new books with unique IDs.

Viewing all books with real-time status (Available/Borrowed).

Searching for books by their ID.

Borrowing and returning books with borrower information tracking.

Calculating and displaying late fines for overdue returns.

Filtering books based on their category.

The system emphasizes user input validation and basic error handling to ensure smooth operation. It runs entirely in the console and is designed to be lightweight, simple, and easy to understand â€” ideal for learning core C++ programming concepts like structures, functions, arrays, and input/output operations.

Skills Demonstrated:

C++ Programming (Functions, Arrays, Structures)

Input Validation and Error Handling

Basic Data Management

Simple User Interface through Console

Logical Thinking and Problem Solving
